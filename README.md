# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

This project is an implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using Python, the NumPy library, and the PyTorch library.

## Description

A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a form of artificial neural network with multiple layers of neurons. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The MLP is capable of learning complex relationships between data, and it's used in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and time series prediction.

## Features

- Flexible and modular implementation of MLP using NumPy.
- Ability to configure the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, activation functions, etc.
- Support for training the network using different datasets.
- Evaluation of network performance on test data.
- Detailed documentation and usage examples.
